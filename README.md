# CSCI231-Project-6
This program uses two overloaded methods. The first method tests to see how many English letters are inputted by the user in a sentence. The second method determines how often a specified character occurs in the sentence. Zero is returned if there are no occurrences, and if the character is not an English letter, -1 is returned.
